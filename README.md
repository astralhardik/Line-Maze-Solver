# ü§ñ PID Controlled Maze Solver Robot

This repository contains the implementation of a **line-following maze solver robot** using **PID control logic** with IR sensors. The robot is capable of navigating a black-line maze, making directional decisions at junctions, and optimizing its path using an intelligent path-reduction algorithm.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This robot uses five IR sensors arranged laterally to detect black lines on a white surface. Based on sensor feedback, it calculates deviation (`error`) and applies a PID controller to steer the robot precisely on the path. It can also:
- Detect junctions
- Record and optimize turns
- Execute a final optimized run through the maze

---

## üîÅ Modes of Operation

1. **Learning Mode**  
   - Follows the maze
   - Stores decisions (L, R, S, B) in a path string

2. **Final Run**  
   - Optimizes the path using known junction patterns
   - Executes the most efficient route through the maze

---

## üß† Key Features

- PID-controlled line following
- IR sensor-based path detection
- Multi-junction decision making
- Path optimization using string manipulation
- Final run with minimal movements
- LED indication on stop point
- Support for both **learning** and **execution** phases
